# Simon-Game
Simon Game built using Backend tools such as JQuery

This is a web page version of the electronic toy game, Simon. Similar to the toy version, the web page tests short term memoery by simulating a series of sound and visual that requires the user to repeat the sequence. The more the user succeeds, the more complex and longer the series gets. Have fun!
